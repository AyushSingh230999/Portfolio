      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Concordia was Elpis' largest and greatest space port... that is until DAHL's mining operations caused "The Crackening". After that, many survivors congregated to the city for safety. Now, Concordia is the safest place on Elpis, protected from the Scavs and deadly creatures across the moon's surface. Concordia was run under the laws of a man who called himself "The Merrif" (a title that "sounded better in His head"), who the citizens had apparent disdain for.</p>
