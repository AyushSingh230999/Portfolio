      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Constructor bots are large, tripedal Hyperion mobile robot factories. They can digistruct Hyperion loaders and surveyors until destroyed.
        Constructors can also appear as Badass Constructors, a tougher variant that has more health and a number of autocannons on their bodies. The autocannons can be destroyed to obtain Second Winds.</p>

      <h3>Backgroud</h3>
      <p>In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, the Constructor's origins is revealed to have been a personal project of Gladstone Katoa. While clearing out a robot factory, Jack's Vault Hunters stumble onto Gladstone and he mentions his prototype constructor. Deeming it to be a better idea than using the factory, Jack has the Vault Hunters assist in the completion of the Constructor by using scavenged parts and installing Felicity's AI. Due to Handsome Jack's refusal to create a copy of Felicity's AI, it goes rogue, forcing Jack's Vault Hunters to cripple it for Gladstone to take control. Although it was never seen for the rest of the story, the Constructor is presumably used to tackle Lost Legion's forces with the bots it can pump out. Later on, what remains of this constructor's framework was used for those seen in Borderlands 2.</p>
