      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Vault is an enigmatic place that is drenched in myth and folklore. After the Atlas corporation found a cache of alien weaponry on Promethea, legends began to emerge about vaults on other worlds. Popular myths and legends held that the Vault must contain something amazing. According to Marcus, the Pandoran Vault would give the finder advanced alien technology, fame, power, and women.</p>

      <h3>Finding The Vault Key</h3>
      <p>An archaeologist named Patricia Tannis, funded by the Dahl Corporation, was sent with a team to Pandora several years before the game begins to research the Vault and find out if it existed, where it was, what was in it, and how to open it. Tannis gradually lost her sanity thanks to the harshness of life on Pandora, while also becoming completely obsessed with finding the Vault as her team were systematically killed by the local fauna.

        Through her research, Tannis discovered that the Vault could be opened at a specific date that came every two hundred years by using a special key comprised of three puzzle-like fragments. She recovered one of the Vault Key fragments, but ultimately lost it to bandits through a misjudged attempt to hide it. It was then that she realized she had a form of psychosis preventing her from leaving her camp at the archaeological site, so she remained there and sent out a call for Vault hunters to help her retrieve the key pieces and open the Vault.</p>
