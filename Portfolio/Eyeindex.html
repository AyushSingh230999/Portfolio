      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Eye of Helios is a location within Helios, the space station in orbit above Pandora.
        Within the Eye of Helios resides The Destroyer's eye, whose laser was enhanced by an amplification nexus to launch devastating orbital strikes.
        The Eye of Helios is only accessible during Eye to Eye. The Lunar Launching Station connection is blocked by debris from the explosion after the mission is completed.</p>

      <h3>Points of Interest</h3>
      <p>This room contains 9 digistruct pods that spawn 6 yellow and 3 red Hyperion chests. Before some patch, those chests were farmable until completion of Eye to Eye (by exiting to Lunar Launching Station and reentering Eye of Helios).</p>
